As a registered user
When I visit '/'
and I click on a link that says "I already have an account"
Then I should see a login form
and I can enter my username and password
and submit the form
and see a welcome message with my username
and my user ID is stored in a session
and I should no longer see the link that says "I already have an account"
and I should see a link that says "Log out"
